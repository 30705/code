FlexCOS is free and Open Source Smartcard Operating System. Since real
Smartcard Hardware without an operating system is hard to come by, FlexCOS
is developed on FPGA Boards with initial support for Xilinx Spartan 6 Chips.
Due to limitations of the ability to distribute FPGA Configuration binaries
a compatible configuration for a given device has to be created first.
Ports to other architectures and platforms can be achieved by changing only
a few files in the FreeRTOS part of FlexCOS.

For general information and detailed instructions on how to get started with
FlexCOS please visit the Wiki pages.
